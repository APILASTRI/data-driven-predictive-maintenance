# Data-driven predictive maintenance

A curated list of predictive maintenance resources. Inspired by [awesome-ml](https://github.com/sdukshis/awesome-ml) and [awesome-anomaly-detection](https://github.com/hoya012/awesome-anomaly-detection). 





## What is Predictive maintenance?

[Predictive maintenance(PdM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_maintenance) techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. 

The main promise of predictive maintenance is to allow convenient scheduling of corrective maintenance and to prevent unexpected equipment failures. The key is "the right information in the right time". 

[Prognostics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognostics) is almost the same concept as predictive maintenance. Prognostics is just a broader concept. Prognostics not only predict failure time, but also calculates the remaining useful life (RUL) and manges a machine as a whole. (Prognostics and Health Mangement).
